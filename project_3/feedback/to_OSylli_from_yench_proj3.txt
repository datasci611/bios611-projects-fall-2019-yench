Good job on the project draft, it looks promising. Some feedback is listed below. Good luck on the report and final presentation!


======================== Non-Template Feecback ========================
1. README file is well-organized and detailed. I might add hyperlink to the folder links and datsets, but that's extra and the README is good enough as is.
2. Maybe only include the datasets that are actually (CLIENT, EE_UDES, ENTRY_EXIT) used in the analysis in the data folder?
3. The 'Q2_Relationship between the average time of stay at UMD and client gender.png' figure's title is truncated.


========================= Template Feedback ===========================
1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
Yes, though without running it, I'm not sure whether it's complete or not because it's not 100% clear what datasets are used. 

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Yes.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
Yes.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
Yes, judging from the questions being asked, the plots are reasonable.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
Structurally it's pretty clear. The R and python scripts are good enough as draft right now, but would be helpful to have more comments in the final product.

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
Yes, the README file does a good job. 

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
Yes, looks good to me.

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
Yes, and each dataset comes with a brief description, very considerate.

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
Not enough information to evaluate yet.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
Not enough information to evaluate yet.

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
Not enough information to evaluate yet, but judging from what is in the draft now, I believe they will be communicated clearly.
