Sorry, there is not enough information to really give any feedback beyond what is below, but good luck on your project and final presentation!

===================    Non-template feedback   =====================
1. I remember Matt saying that .gitignore and .gitkeep should be included in the project 3 repository.
2. The standard project structure has a folder for scripts, though I'm not sure whether it's necessary when the number of scripts is small.

====================   Template feedback  ======================
1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
Yes, the Makefile is there. It is at a preliminary stage though.

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Not yet.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
Not yet.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
No plots yet.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
Not enough information to evaluate.

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
Not enough information to evaluate.

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
Not enough information to evaluate.

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
The README file, which is from project 2, does contain some information on the data source, although it needs to be modified for project 3.

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
No figures yet.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
