# BIOS611 Project 3 

## Background and objective
Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) is a non-profit organization providing shelter, food, clothing, hygiene kits, and other services to people who are homeless or in emergent needs in Durham. This projects focuses on the shelter aspect of UMD, and aims to understand how the shelter is utilized, what the shelter has achieved, and potentially provides ideas for future services. 

## Audience
UMD and stakeholders are the target audience of this project. 

## Questions
Specifically, there are 3 sets of questions I would like to address in this project:
1. Who uses UMD's shelter? Are their composition different from that of local population, in terms of race, gender, age, veteran status, and history of domestic violence, adjusted by year? 

2. How do clients utilize UMD's shelter, in terms of seasonality, duration, interval between shelter stay, and number of usage? 

3. What do clients walk away with after their stay in the shelter? Are we able to predict their return by what they recieve or achieve in the shelter?


## Data source
 
1. UMD
UMD provided a total of 16 datasets containing information of clients upon their entry to and exit from their shelter. X of the datasets are used in this project, as listed below.

2. United Census Bureau
The demographic data of Durham population is obtained from the US Census Bureau. Specifically, the following data sets are used: 
[American Community Survey Table DP05 2017: ACS 5-Year Estimates Data Profiles](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?hidePreview=true&g=0600000US3706390932&q=Durham%20township,%20Durham%20County,%20North%20Carolina&table=DP05&tid=ACSDP5Y2017.DP05&lastDisplayedRow=93&y=)


## Analysis approach
R: The analyses of three questions will come with summary statistics and plots, and for question 1 and 3 there will be statistical tests.
Makefile: for downloading data and running R scripts, and production of dependency plot
Docker: create an environment for running this project that is portable and reproducible 
Python:?
